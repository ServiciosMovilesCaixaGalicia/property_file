property_file is a configuration file parser.

It supports two popular configuration formats - Apache and C-like,
property substitution and file inclusion. It works with Unix, DOS and
Mac files. Both formats are line-oriented, declaration may be
continued at next line with '\' before new line.

See property_file.html(EDoc generated) for documentation and
property_file_test.erl for examples.

You need 'mlex' to use this module.

Your comments and suggestions are welcome.
